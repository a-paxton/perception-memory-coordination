\begin{abstract}
With cognitive scientists' increasing interest in moving outside of the
lab, recent advances in crowdsourcing platforms can help strike a
balance between the tight experimental control of lab designs and the
affordances of web-based experiments to reach beyond traditional
undergraduate subject pools. By taking advantage of new tools,
scientists interested in social cognition and behavior can create new
designs and adapt traditional ones to deliver experiments at scale.
Dallinger is one such tool, providing researchers with an open-source
experiment platform that provides end-to-end automation of the
experiment pipeline, from participant recruitment and consent to data
de-identification and participant compensation. Here we demonstrate how
Dallinger can be used to run complex experimental studies of interactive
human social behavior, as a demonstration of its potential to study
social cognition and behavior using designs drawn from across cognitive
science.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\section{Method}\label{method}

All research activities were completed in compliance with oversight from
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the University of
California, Berkeley.

\subsection{Participants}\label{participants}

Participants (\emph{n} = 12) were individually recruited from Amazon
Mechanical Turk to participate as dyads (\emph{n} = 6). Participants
were paired with one another according to the order in which they began
the experiment. All participants were over 18 years of age and fluent
English speakers (self-reported), located within the U.S.

The experiment lasted an average of 11.96 minutes (range: 8.13---17.66
minutes). In return for their participation, all participants were paid
\$1.33 as base pay for finishing the experiment. Each participant also
earned a bonus based of up to \$2 for the entire experiment based on
mean accuracy over all trials (mean = \$1.85; range: \$1.72---\$1.93).

\subsection{Procedure}\label{procedure}

All data collection procedures were completed through the experiment
platform Dallinger (v3.4.1;
\url{http://github.com/dallinger/Dallinger}), deployed on Amazon
Mechanical Turk (\url{http://mturk.com}). Code for the experiment is
available on GitHub
(\url{http://github.com/thomasmorgan/joint-estimation-game}), and the
resulting experiment data are available on the OSF repository for the
project (\url{https://osf.io/8fu7x/}).

Each participant was individually recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk to
play a ``Line Estimation Game'' (advertisement: ``Test your skills!'').
Upon completing informed consent, participants were told that they would
be playing a game in which they would be required to remember and
re-create line lengths. Participants were informed that they would be
complete their training trials individually and would then begin playing
with a partner. Participants were given no information about their
partner other than the guess that their partner made; no information
about the partner's identity was shared.

In each trial, participants were shown 3 red lines (see figure;
\textbf{NB}: add figure) and were asked to remember all three of them.
The 3 stimulus lines were displayed for 2 seconds then removed,
providing participants with a blank screen for 0.5 seconds. Participants
were then told which line to re-create (\#1, \#2, or \#3) and were then
given 1 second to submit their guess at how long the target line had
been. To do so, participants were given a blank box and used their
cursor to fill in the box with a blue line.

During training, participants were then shown the correct length of the
target line (as a grey bar above their own guess) for 2 seconds. This
was accompanied by a message telling the participant that they had
guessed correctly (``Your guess was correct!'') or incorrectly (``Your
guess was incorrect'') or that they had not submitted a guess within the
1-second time limit (``You didn't respond in time'').

A pilot version of this study showed that participants adapted learned
too quickly when given only 1 line to remember and recreate. The
additional 2 lines were added to strictly increase the memory load, as
opposed to adding difficulty in other ways (e.g., creating a moving
stimulus).

During testing, participants no longer received information about
whether their guess was correct or incorrect.
