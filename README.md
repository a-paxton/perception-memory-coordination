# Perception, Memory, and Coordination: Code for Paxton, Morgan, Suchow, & Griffiths (2018, *Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society*)

This repo contains the code for analyses exploring interpersonal coordination of
perception and memory during minimally interactive contexts (Paxton, Morgan,
Suchow, & Griffiths, 2018, *Proceedings of the Cognitive Science Society*).

## Proceedings

The proceedings paper was written using an R template for reproducible CogSci
proceedings papers ((`cogsci2016`)[http://github.com/kemacdonald/cogsci2016]).
The `.Rmd`, `.tex`, and PDF that result from that are available in the
`study_1-cogsci2018` directory in this repository.

## Experiment code

This research involves data collected using [Dallinger](http://dallinger.docs.io),
an open-source experiment creation platform. The code for the experiment can be
found here: https://github.com/thomasmorgan/joint-estimation-game

## Notes on viewing and running

For best viewing in a browser, we recommend selecting
`perception_memory_coordination-study_1.md`, rather than the similarly named
`.Rmd` file. (Analyses should be run using the `.Rmd` file of the same name.)

For those unfamiliar with R markdown, we recommend taking a look at [RStudio's
introduction to R markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) before attempting
to run the `.Rmd` file. (Be sure to download [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
first, if you do not already have it installed on your machine.)
